          "question": " Why Control is required for the export of Nuclear related items?",
          "answer": [
            "Export Control is one of the important pillars of Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Security. Robust export control serves either as a deterrent and/or delays the efforts of the proliferators to acquire Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) items or related technologies. This ensures that legitimate trade in strategic goods, dual-use goods, services, and technology continue to grow. The illegitimate trade is controlled to eliminate any possibility of such items falling into the hands of terrorists and other non-state actors with wrong intentions."
